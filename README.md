# Active Goals

Adding an already existing Unity A* method, just as the 2d project done pastly.

# Achieved Goals

Making a process for the arm to go from a later best configuration to the current best one in a controlled way in order to avoid strange jumps in evolution, done by using the maxStep variable. ✅

Making it possible for the simulation run a limited amount of generations and saving data about it, the fitness evolution along with other aspects. ✅
